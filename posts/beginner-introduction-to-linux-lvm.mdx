## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. What is LVM ?

LVM is used to create and handle logical volumes in linux.
It is used for replacement of partitioning and it is very smooth compare to partitioning, for example we can reduce a file system to extend another, whatever the position on the disk of these file systems.
Without LVM, you will have limitations when trying to extend a partition to the left for example.
The great power of LVM is resizing without risk.

If one of the physical volume is dead, it's all the logical volumes in this physical volume which are dead.
That's why we could use LVM with RAID.

### 1.2. Definitions

| Name | Full name       | Description                                                                                                           |
| ---- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PV   | Physical volume | Hard disk, partitions, RAID volume
| VG   | Volume Group    | One or more PV                                                                                                        |
| LV   | Logical Volumes | VG are cut into LV, then formatted and mounted in a file system. LV are like partitions                               |
| FS   | File system     | This is a way to store information and store them in files. They have a mounted point (like /) and a type (like ext4) |

### 1.3. Setup

You can list all your hard drive with the following command :

```
vagrant@lvm:~$ lsblk
NAME   MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda      8:0    0  20G  0 disk
└─sda1   8:1    0  20G  0 part /
sdb      8:16   0   5G  0 disk
sdc      8:32   0   5G  0 disk
sdd      8:48   0   5G  0 disk
```

I have created a virtual machine on debian, and I added 3 virtual hard disks of 5Gio (sdb, sdc, sdd).
Then, I created 2 partitions of 2.5Gio on `/dev/sdd` (sdd1, sdd2) with `fdisk` :

```shell
sudo fdisk /dev/sdd
```

And two partitions of 5G on `/dev/sdb` and `/dev/sdc`.

Now, here is the state of our VM :

```
vagrant@lvm:~$ lsblk
NAME   MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda      8:0    0   20G  0 disk
└─sda1   8:1    0   20G  0 part /
sdb      8:16   0    5G  0 disk
└─sdb1   8:17   0    5G  0 part
sdc      8:32   0    5G  0 disk
└─sdc1   8:33   0    5G  0 part
sdd      8:48   0    5G  0 disk
├─sdd1   8:49   0  2.5G  0 part
└─sdd2   8:50   0  2.5G  0 part
```

Last but not least, you need to install **LVM** with the following command :

```shell
sudo apt install lvm2
```

## 2. Physical Volumes (PV)

We can create our first Physical Volumes for the newly created partitions :

```shell
sudo pvcreate /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1 /dev/sdd1 /dev/sdd2
```

Then, we can list all physical volumes with ``sudo pvs`` :

```
vagrant@lvm:~$ sudo pvs
  PV         VG Fmt  Attr PSize  PFree
  /dev/sdb1     lvm2 ---  <5.00g <5.00g
  /dev/sdc1     lvm2 ---  <5.00g <5.00g
  /dev/sdd1     lvm2 ---   2.50g  2.50g
  /dev/sdd2     lvm2 ---  <2.50g <2.50g
```

<Info>
You can also use these commands :
- ``pvscan`` 
- ``pvdisplay``
</Info>

If you want to delete a PV, it is possible with the command ``pvremove`` just like ``pvcreate``.
Here is an example :

```shell
sudo pvremove /dev/sdd2
```

Output :

```
  Labels on physical volume "/dev/sdd2" successfully wiped.
```

Here is the confirmation :

```
vagrant@lvm:~$ sudo pvs
  PV         VG Fmt  Attr PSize  PFree
  /dev/sdb1     lvm2 ---  <5.00g <5.00g
  /dev/sdc1     lvm2 ---  <5.00g <5.00g
  /dev/sdd1     lvm2 ---   2.50g  2.50g
```

Now, I can recreate the PV with the following command : 
```shell
  sudo pvcreate /dev/sdd2
```

## 3. Volume Groups (VG)

Volume Groups are used to create a pool of storage with your **PV**.

### 3.1. Creating and listing VGs

I can create a volume group that includes all our **PV** with this command :
```
vagrant@lvm:~$ sudo vgcreate vg1 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1 /dev/sdd1 /dev/sdd2
  Volume group "vg1" successfully created
```

The first argument is the name of our volume group, and the others are our **PV**.

Now, I can check my VG with the command ``vgs``, I have this output :
```
  VG  #PV #LV #SN Attr   VSize  VFree
  vg1   4   0   0 wz--n- 14.98g 14.98g
```

The VG **vg1** appear, so our VG is now created.
<Info>
Just like for PV, you can use other commands to list all your VG : ``vgdisplay``, ``vgscan``. I let you test these commands.
</Info>

With the previous commands, you can't see which PV was used to create this new VG. If you want to get this information, you can run this command :

```shell
sudo pvdisplay -S vgname=<your_vg_name>
```

For example, to list all the PV linked to our VG **vg1** :

```shell
sudo pvdisplay -S vgname=vg1
```

Output :
```
  --- Physical volume ---
  PV Name               /dev/sdb1
  VG Name               vg1
  PV Size               <5.00 GiB / not usable 3.00 MiB
  Allocatable           yes
  PE Size               4.00 MiB
  Total PE              1279

  PV UUID               h5Yq9X-g8Eg-nufk-ssX6-eLCA-xOAc-6Glvef

  --- Physical volume ---
  PV Name               /dev/sdd1
  VG Name               vg1
  PV Size               2.50 GiB / not usable 4.00 MiB
  Allocatable           yes
  PE Size               4.00 MiB
  Total PE              639
  Free PE               639

  VG Name               vg1
  PV Size               <2.50 GiB / not usable 3.00 MiB
  Allocatable           yes
  PE Size               4.00 MiB
  Total PE              639

  PV UUID               g0kHPl-jpoN-7V5y-Exla-xW8W-VnVt-C5vkp5
```

### 3.2. Extending and reducing a VG

Extending a volume group is the action of adding a new physical volume to our VG.
With our previous manipulations we have one volume group named **vg1** containing 4 **PV**.
Let's reduce this VG by removing the **PV** ``/dev/sdd1``.
To do this, we are going to use the command below :

```shell
sudo vgreduce <vg_name> <pv1> <pv2> ...
```

Let's do it :

```
vagrant@lvm:~$ sudo vgreduce vg1 /dev/sdd2
  Removed "/dev/sdd2" from volume group "vg1"
```

We can take a look about the current state :

```
vagrant@lvm:~$ sudo pvdisplay -S vgname=vg1
  --- Physical volume ---
  PV Name               /dev/sdb1
  VG Name               vg1
  PV Size               <5.00 GiB / not usable 3.00 MiB
  Allocatable           yes
  PE Size               4.00 MiB
  Total PE              1279
  Free PE               1279
  Allocated PE          0
  PV UUID               tabnFz-9Pee-Amdf-3opL-FatS-cBLH-riW4oS

  --- Physical volume ---
  PV Name               /dev/sdc1
  VG Name               vg1
  PV Size               <5.00 GiB / not usable 3.00 MiB
  Allocatable           yes
  PE Size               4.00 MiB
  Total PE              1279
  Free PE               1279
  Allocated PE          0
  PV UUID               h5Yq9X-g8Eg-nufk-ssX6-eLCA-xOAc-6Glvef

  --- Physical volume ---
  PV Name               /dev/sdd1
  VG Name               vg1
  PV Size               2.50 GiB / not usable 4.00 MiB
  Allocatable           yes
  PE Size               4.00 MiB
  Total PE              639
  Free PE               639
  Allocated PE          0
  PV UUID               kpa1w6-435i-cUO4-5LLj-uU0u-sDvO-X0dopb
```

You have guessed, you can extend a **VG** just like this :

```shell
sudo vgreduce <vgname> <pv1> <pv2> ....
```

Now, try to add previously deleted **PV** before reading the answer.

Answer :
```shell
sudo vgextend vg1 /dev/sdd2
```

Well played !

### 3.3. Delete a VG

You can delete a **VG** just like this :
```shell
sudo vgremove <vg_name>
```

> For example : ``sudo vgremove vg1``.

<Warning>Don't run the above command if you want to read the rest of the article.</Warning>


## 4. Logical Volumes (LV)

![img][img_lv]
[Source](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/5/html/deployment_guide/ch-lvm)

Volumes groups are like your hard disks, and your logical volumes are like the partitions on these disks.
Indeed, you can format a **LV** with a file system of your choice and mount it wherever you want.

### 4.1. Creating a LV

You can create a new logical volume like this :

```shell
sudo lvcreate -L <size> -n <lvname> <vgname>
```

- ``-L`` for the size of the LV. You can use **"GB"** **"MB"** and **"KB"**. For example ``2.5MB``.
- ``-n`` is for naming your new LV.

<Info>
If you want a **LV** to take 50% of the free space, you can use the `-l` flag instead of `-L`. For example :
`-l 50%FREE`
</Info>



For example, I create a new **LV** named **lv1** :

```
vagrant@lvm:~$ sudo lvcreate -L 8GB -n lv1 vg1
  Logical volume "lv1" created.
```

Check if it is good with :

```shell
sudo lvs
```

And here is the main purpose of **LVM**. We are able to create a **LV** of 8GB without any hard disk without any disk of this capacity.
Now, we can extend, reduce, delete, format this **LV** without worrying with about our hard disks or partitions.

<Warning>
When you create a new **LV**, make sure the VG from you are creating the **LV** has enough space.
</Warning>

### 4.2. Operations on LV

#### 4.2.1. Create a file system

Your **LV** is located here : ``/dev/<vg_name>/<lv_name>``.

Now, we are going to create a new file system on the **LV** `lv1`.

You can format it as **ext4** :

```shell
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/vg1/lv1
```

- Output :

```
mke2fs 1.46.2 (28-Feb-2021)
Creating filesystem with 2097152 4k blocks and 524288 inodes
Filesystem UUID: 5789707e-a9b9-4714-9d34-a02227c1f5b7
Superblock backups stored on blocks:
        32768, 98304, 163840, 229376, 294912, 819200, 884736, 1605632

Allocating group tables: done
Writing inode tables: done
Creating journal (16384 blocks): done
Writing superblocks and filesystem accounting information: done
```

Now, you can mount it :

```shell
sudo mount -t ext4 /dev/vg1/lv1 /mnt
```

And use it like for storing file.

#### 4.2.2. Resize (extend or reduce) a LV

You can resize a logical volume with the command ``lvresize``, ``lvextend`` or ``lvreduce``. 

<Warning>
You must check if the **VG** has enough free space if you want to extend your **LV** !
</Warning>

Here is an example :

```shell
sudo lvresize -L +2GB vg1/lv1
```

- Output :

```
  Size of logical volume vg1/lv1 changed from 8.00 GiB (2048 extents) to 10.00 GiB (2560 extents).
  Logical volume vg1/lv1 successfully resized.
```

Now, you have resized successfully your **LV**, then you need to update the filesystem. For **ext4**, the command are ``e2fsck`` and ``resize2fs`` :

```shell
sudo e2fsck -f /dev/vg1/lv1
```

then :

```shell
sudo resize2fs /dev/vg1/lv1
```

Now, your file system is resized too, and you can mount it.

## 5. Snapshot and restoration

The LVM snapshots will help you to backup and restore **LV**.
Later, I will write an article about **RAID**, which is used for the same purpose.

The command is :

```shell
sudo lvcreate -s -n <snap_name> -L <size> <lv_name>
```

You can then mount the snapshot.

<Info>
Make sure the corresponding **VG** has enough space.
</Info>

Let's mount our **LV** **lv1** and create some files/directory into it :

```
vagrant@lvm:~$ sudo mkdir -p /mnt/lv1
vagrant@lvm:~$ sudo mount /dev/vg1/lv1 /mnt/lv1
vagrant@lvm:~$ cd /mnt/lv1/
vagrant@lvm:/mnt/lv1$ ls
lost+found  test
vagrant@lvm:/mnt/lv1$ sudo touch file1 file2
vagrant@lvm:/mnt/lv1$ sudo mkdir dir1 dir2 dir3
```

Now, here is the state of our **LV** :

```
vagrant@lvm:/mnt/lv1$ ls -l
total 32
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root  4096 Nov  6 12:00 dir1
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root  4096 Nov  6 12:00 dir2
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root  4096 Nov  6 12:00 dir3
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     0 Nov  6 12:00 file1
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     0 Nov  6 12:00 file2
drwx------ 2 root root 16384 Nov  5 18:55 lost+found
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root  4096 Nov  5 18:58 test
```

We are going to create a snapshot of our **LV** :

```shell
sudo lvcreate -s -n snap_lv1 -L 1GB vg1/lv1
```

Let's simulate a loss of data in our LV :

```shell
sudo rmdir /mnt/lv1/dir2/ && sudo rm /mnt/lv1/file1
```

Try to restore from the snapshot with `lvconvert` :

```
vagrant@lvm:/mnt/lv1$ sudo lvconvert --merge /dev/vg1/snap_lv1
  Delaying merge since origin is open.
  Merging of snapshot vg1/snap_lv1 will occur on next activation of vg1/lv1.
```

You must unmount the **LV** and re-activate it. Follow these steps :

```shell
sudo umount /mnt/lv1/
```

Then :

```shell
sudo lvchange -an /dev/vg1/lv1
```

Finally :

```shell
sudo lvchange -ay /dev/vg1/lv1
```

Now you can mount the **LV**, and **surprise** ! The deleted file/directory appear !
You've just restored your **LV** thanks to a snapshot.
